### Jupyter Notebooks for RnmrQuant1D

Here are 5 Jupyter Notebooks that correspond to the 5 steps to follow to carry out absolute quantifications using the R package RnmrQuant1D.

* The preliminary step consists of preparing all the spectra (samples, standards, and quality control), as well as the three files necessary for proper operation (sample list, standards and quality control, and quantification profile). We recommend reading the [dedicated tutorial](https://github.com/djacob65/RnmrQuant1D/wiki) beforehand.

* Step One: Generate the Sample File
    * JNB 'sample-table.ipynb'
    * See https://github.com/djacob65/RnmrQuant1D/wiki/1%E2%80%90Samples

* Step Two: Check the Quantification Profile
    * JNB 'check-profile.ipynb'
    * See https://github.com/djacob65/RnmrQuant1D/wiki/4%E2%80%90profile%E2%80%90check

* Step 3: Check if the calibration is good with a quality control
    * JNB 'check-QC-QS.ipynb'
    * See https://github.com/djacob65/RnmrQuant1D/wiki/2%E2%80%90QC%E2%80%90QS

* Step Four: Calculate all absolute quantifications
    * JNB 'process-samples.ipynb'
    * See https://github.com/djacob65/RnmrQuant1D/wiki

* Step Five: Check certain zones or compounds
    * JNB 'plot-samples.ipynb'
    * See https://github.com/djacob65/RnmrQuant1D/wiki
